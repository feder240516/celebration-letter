# Letter template
This is a template of a letter that can be used to show your affection to anyone you want. Currently hosted at https://feder240516.github.io/celebration-letter/ 

Feel free to fork this project if you want to customize it.

## How to use it
In the file components/Letter/Letter.js, starting around line 20, there is an array of messages that are the content of every page. Modify them to your needs.
Also right there are the variables sender and destiny, which will be the words found on the envelope of the letter.

## About resources
If you don't like the audio and background resources that I added, you can find more at https://freesound.org/ for audio and https://galactic.ink/bg/ or http://bg.siteorigin.com/ for backgrounds.

## And finally...
... if this resource helped you, let me know at federicoreinavinchira@gmail.com or star the project on github. In the future, I'll be releasing a version and a webpage for allowing to customize the content without having to fork the project, so be patient. If you find any issue, write it in the issues panel or email it to me.

Btw, as I had some personal info in the letter, I rebased the commits to delete it.
